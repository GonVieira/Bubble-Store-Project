What's the difference between a diamond and a chunk of coal? \n The building blocks are the same, but end results couldn't be more different. \n Quadra's Turbo-R V-Tech is the queen of the road, a car that turns heads even when you're not burning rubber.",

The pedigree engine under its hood puts this car on equal footing with professional racing vehicles, and the interior feels like a 5-star penthouse suite.
